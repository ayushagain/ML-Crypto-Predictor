### **AI-Powered Cryptocurrency Predictions**

**CryptoForecast is an advanced ML-based application designed to predict cryptocurrency trends. Built using Python and Streamlit, it leverages historical market data to provide insightful forecasts, helping users make data-informed decisions.**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Core Technologies**

CryptoForecast is powered by:

- **Streamlit** - For an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Yahoo Finance API** - To fetch real-time cryptocurrency market data.
- **CoinGecko API** - Provides access to top cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** - A deep learning model optimized for time-series forecasting.
- **Plotly** - For generating interactive and dynamic financial visualizations.
- **Pandas** - For effective data manipulation and analysis.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **How It Works**

1. Choose a cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, ETH).
2. Fetch historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
3. Train the LSTM model on the last 60 days of data.
4. Generate price forecasts for 1‚Äì90 days.
5. Visualize predictions through interactive charts.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

- **Live market data** - Get real-time updates on cryptocurrency prices.
- **Custom prediction range** - Forecast prices for up to 90 days.
- **Interactive graphs** - Analyze past trends and future predictions visually.
- **Downloadable reports** - Save predictions for future reference.
- **Beginner-friendly UI** - Simple and easy-to-use interface for all users.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**
