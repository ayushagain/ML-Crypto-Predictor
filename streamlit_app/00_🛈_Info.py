### **AI-Powered Cryptocurrency Price Predictions**

**CryptoForecaster** is a cutting-edge machine learning application designed to predict cryptocurrency prices. Built by **Ayush (ayushagain)**, this app leverages historical data and advanced algorithms to forecast trends for popular cryptocurrencies, empowering users with actionable insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

CryptoForecaster is built using the following tools and frameworks:

- **Streamlit** - For creating an intuitive and interactive web interface.
- **Yahoo Finance API (YFinance)** - To fetch real-time cryptocurrency data.
- **CoinGecko API** - To dynamically retrieve the top 2,500 cryptocurrencies by market cap from a pool of over 17,000 tokens. For an updated list of tickers, check out the Jupyter Notebook: [CoinGeckoToCsv.ipynb](https://github.com/ayushagain/CryptoForecaster/blob/main/assets/dataCleaning/CoinGeckoToCsv.ipynb).
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** - A neural network model optimized for time-series forecasting.
- **Plotly** - For generating dynamic and interactive financial charts.
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and processing.
