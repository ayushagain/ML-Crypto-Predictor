## 🛠️ **How It's Built**

CryptoPredictor is built with the following core frameworks and tools:

- **Streamlit** - To create an intuitive web interface.
- **Yahoo Finance API (YFinance)** - To fetch up-to-date cryptocurrency data.
- **CoinGecko API** - To dynamically fetch the top 2,500 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation from a pool of 17,061 available tokens, ensuring access to real-time data for popular selections. For an updated list of the 2,500 tickers based on market capitalisation, users can run the Jupyter Notebook available at: [CoinGeckoToCsv.ipynb](https://github.com/josericodata/CryptoPredictor/tree/main/assets/dataCleaning/CoinGeckoToCsv.ipynb).
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** - A neural network model optimised for time-series predictions.
- **Plotly** - To generate dynamic and interactive financial charts.
- **Pandas** - To manipulate and process cryptocurrency datasets.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **How It Works**

1. The user selects a cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, ETH).
2. Historical price data is retrieved using the Yahoo Finance API.
3. The LSTM model is trained on the past 60 days of historical data.
4. Predictions are generated for the next 1–90 days.
5. Results are displayed with interactive charts and tables.

## ✨ **Key Features**

- **Real-time cryptocurrency data** - Access accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Interactive charts** - View historical trends and future predictions visually.
- **Custom prediction ranges** - Forecast prices for 1 to 90 days.
- **Downloadable CSV** - Save prediction results for further analysis.
- **User-friendly interface** - Accessible for novice and experienced users alike.

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

Planned improvements and new features include:

- **Integration of advanced ML models** (e.g., Prophet) for better prediction accuracy.
- **Support for additional cryptocurrencies** to expand coverage.
- **Volatility analysis** to measure price swings and potential risks.
- **User accounts and history tracking** for tailored predictions and personalised experiences.

---

## 🔧 **Environment Setup**

The CryptoPredictor app is built and tested using the following software environment:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy)
- **Python Version**: Python 3.10.12

Ensure your environment matches or exceeds these versions for optimal performance.

## 📋 **Important Notes**

- **CoinGecko API Error 429**: If too many requests are made to the URL, the API may block further requests. Please restart or close the app, and try again after a minute or two. The data should then be available.
- **Using the Crypto Predictor**:
    1. Select a cryptocurrency from the dropdown menu.
    2. Choose the desired prediction range using the slider.
    3. Adjust the **Epochs** slider to set the number of training iterations. Note: Higher epochs result in longer training times but can improve model accuracy.
    4. Click the **Run Prediction** button to generate results.
